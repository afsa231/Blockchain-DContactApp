# Blockchain-DContactApp
BlockChain Decentralized contact app
Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger technology that records transactions across many computers in a way that ensures the data cannot be altered retroactively. Each block in the chain contains a list of transactions, and these blocks are securely linked using cryptography. Blockchain is widely used for ensuring the security, transparency, and immutability of data, making it ideal for applications like cryptocurrency, supply chain management, and secure data storage.

Use of Blockchain
Blockchain provides a secure, transparent, and tamper-resistant method for storing and sharing information. Its decentralized nature ensures that no single entity has full control over the data, making it a popular choice for financial transactions, smart contracts, and various data-sensitive applications.

My Blockchain Project
I developed a blockchain-based application designed to securely store contact information. This app ensures that contact details are stored safely and cannot be tampered with due to the decentralized nature of blockchain. I used Ganache to simulate the blockchain environment locally, allowing data to be safely saved and tested on the blockchain. This project demonstrates how blockchain can be used to enhance the security and integrity of data storage.
